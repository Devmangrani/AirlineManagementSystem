## Introduction

The **Airline Management System** automates the management of airports and airlines, offering features for managing airline commercial and operational priorities. The system supports storing and retrieving data related to passengers, flights, and reservations, thus improving the efficiency of airline business operations.

## Problem Definition

The system automates the airline registration process, providing detailed information about passengers, flights, and bookings. It allows adding, deleting, and updating records based on passenger requirements. MySQL is used for data storage and retrieval, ensuring changes in the frontend are reflected in the backend.

## Project Need

The airline management system offers:

- Faster operations
- Increased accuracy and reliability
- Access to comprehensive and up-to-date information
- Flexibility in reservations and cancellations from any location

## Requirements

### Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10
- **Frontend**: Java NetBeans 8.2, JDK 8
- **Backend**: MySQL

### Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: Core i3 or higher
- **Processor Speed**: 2.3 GHz or higher
- **Hard Disk**: 400 GB or more
- **RAM**: Minimum 2 GB

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The Entity Relationship (ER) diagram illustrates the relationships between different entities in the database, such as Airlines, Airline Employees, and Customers/Travelers.

## Schema Diagram

The schema diagram represents the logical structure of the database, defining entities and relationships among them.

## Implementation

### Backend Implementation

The backend is implemented using MySQL, a relational database management system (RDBMS). Tables include `cancellation`, `flight`, `login`, `passenger`, `payment`, `reservation`, and `sector`.

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend is implemented in **Java Core** using **Swing**. Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java that provides a rich set of components such as buttons, checkboxes, and more.

### Creating Mainframe Class

The `Mainframe` class is the main class for the application, handling the initialization and GUI components.

## Snapshots

Here are some snapshots from the project:

1. **Login Operation**
2. **Mainframe**
3. **Drop-down Menu**
4. **Flight Information**
5. **Adding Customer**
6. **Payment Details**
7. **Journey Details**
8. **Cancellation**
9. **Backend Records**

## Conclusion

This project on **Airline Management System** automates the registration process of airline systems, providing detailed information on passengers, flights, and bookings. The project demonstrates various aspects of computer science, especially in developing online applications.
